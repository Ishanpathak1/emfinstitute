              Music created after 1950, particularly music created from the invention of the digital audio workstation, electronic instruments, and digital technology, led to a musical revolution in the thought and practice of music composition and performance. The period was a time of new ideas, sounds, and thoughts about composing and performing. It was an incredibly imaginative and innovative time in the history of music.
